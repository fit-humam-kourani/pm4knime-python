This package implements the node Heuristics Miner. 
<p>
The <code>HeuristicsMinerModel</code> wraps the ProM plugin HeuristicsMiner. 
It accepts the event log PortObject as input and mines a Petri net as final result, while 
a Heuristics Net is generated as an intermediate result.
<p>
The <code>HeuristicsMinerView</code> shows the intermediate result - Heuristics Net.
