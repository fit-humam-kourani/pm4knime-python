	<shortDescription>This node implements the Hybrid Miner to discover a causal graph from an event log.</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node implements the Heuristics Miner to discover a process
			model.
			Heuristics Miner is an algorithm that acts on the directly-follows Graph,
			providing way to handle with noise and to find dependency between
			activities. An heuristics net or causal
			net is the output, which is a directed graph with activities as nodes,
			dependency interpreted as arcs and bindings.
			The Heuristics Net can be then converted into a Petri net.
			<br />
			This node shows the Heuristics Net as one internal
			result in View "Heuristic Net", while it
			outputs a Petri net after an implicit conversion.

		<option name="Event classifer">The event classifier is chosen to classify the event
			log.</option>
		<option name="All tasks connected">Every task needs to have at least one input and
			output arc, except the initial and the final activity.
		</option>
		<option name="Long distance dependency">Show long distance relations in the model.
		</option>


		<option name="Threshold: Relative-to-best">The admissible distance between directly follows
			relations for an activity and the activity's best one. At 0 only the best directly
			follows relation will be shown for every activity, at 100 all will be
			shown.
		</option>
		<option name="Threshold: Dependency">The strength of the directly follows relations
			determines when to show arcs (based on how frequently one activity is followed by another).
		</option>
		<option name="Threshold: Length-one-loops">Show arcs based on frequency of L1L observations
		</option>
		<option name="Threshold: Length-two-loops">Show arcs based on frequency of L2L observations
		</option>
		<option name="Threshold: Long distance">Show arcs based on how frequently one activity is
			eventually followed by another</option>
