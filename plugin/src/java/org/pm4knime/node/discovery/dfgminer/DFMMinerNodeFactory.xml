        <intro> This node is created for discovering Directly-Follows Model as a graph. It accepts an event log as input and generates DirectlyFollowsModel as output.
        In this package without note, Directly-Follows Model  is abbreviated as DFM. A DFM is composed of activities in rectangle, 
        which are connected with arcs for directly-follows relation. The green rectangles represent the start activities, while the red
        ones for the end activities.
