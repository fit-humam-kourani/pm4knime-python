    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Accept the Event Log to generate a process tree. 
        Process tree is a block-structured process model, where the (inner) nodes are operators such as sequence, 
        and choice, while leaves are activities. With process tree, it guarantees the soundness of process model. 
        
        <br />
		This node output process tree as output. Later, the process tree can be converted into Petri net.
