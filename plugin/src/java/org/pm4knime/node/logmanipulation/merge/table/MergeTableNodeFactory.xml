	        <li>Internal Trace Merge: traces with the same caseID are merge into a single trace containing all events from these traces.
            </li>
	        <li>Internal Event Merge: traces with the same caseID are merge into a single trace, and the events with same eventID in this trace are merge into a single event.</li>
