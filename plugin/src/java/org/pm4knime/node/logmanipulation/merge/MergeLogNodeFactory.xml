         Separate Trace: For the traces with same caseID, we still put them together. 
         Ignore Trace: For the traces with the same caseID from the second event log, we ignore those traces.
         Internal Trace Merge: For the traces with the same caseID, we merge all events from two traces together.
         			But the trace attributes, we modify them according to the options.
         Internal Event Merge: In traces with same caseID, the events with same eventID 
                    merge together but with different attributes chosen from the table below.
