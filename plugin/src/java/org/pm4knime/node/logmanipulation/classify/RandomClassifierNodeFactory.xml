    <shortDescription>
        Random Classify Event Log node is supposed to classify the event log randomly based on trace variants.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Current node classifies the event log based on trace variant. Trace variant is a set of traces 
        which have the same event classes sequence. The following inputs are required:
         a given label, a list of possible value and the corresponding percent. 
         <br/> For example, given one Label Name "kpi", it has the following distribution, 
         {"pos", 0.5} and {"neg", 0.5}. If there are 2 trace variants and each trace variant includes 10 traces, then
         the in each trace variant, 5 traces are assigned with  "pos" for label "kpi", 5 traces are assigned as "neg". 
         If the sum doesn't match the total trace number, the one with the highest percent will be assigned to the difference value.

        <option name="Label Name">The category name for classification</option>
        <option name="Label Values">The possible label value.</option>
        <option name="Label Value Percentage">The percentage of corresponding label value for one trace variant. 
        The value is between 0 - 1.0.  The sum of the all percentage values should be 1.
