        <intro>
    This node implements a JavaScript Visualization of a Petri Net.
    A Petri Net in the context of process mining is a directed bipartite graph that visualizes all possible traces (order of executed activities)
    <br/>
    A Petri Net consists of places, transitions, and arcs that connect them.  
    Input arcs connect places with transitions, while output arcs start at a transition 
    and end at a place. Places can contain tokens. The placement of tokens defines the state of the Petri net. There is a start and a goal state.
    The start state has only a token in the green place (source). The goal state has all tokens in the double margin place (goal).
    The transitions are gray and narrow if they are silent. The transitions have a label in them if they execute an activity.
    A transition can only fire if all places that have an arc from place to transition have at least one token in them.
    If a transition fires then every place that has an arc outgoing from the transition increases its token by one.
