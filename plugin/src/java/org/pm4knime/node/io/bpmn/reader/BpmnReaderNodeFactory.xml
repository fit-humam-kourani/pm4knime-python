                <b>Gateways:</b> gateways in BPMN are used to control the flow of execution within a process. They serve various purposes, such as decision-making, splitting the flow into multiple paths, or merging multiple paths into a single path. Gateways are depicted as diamond shapes. Supported Gateway Types:
                <ul>
                    <li>
