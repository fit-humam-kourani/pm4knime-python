        <intro>This node converts a petni net (.pnml) into a bpmn (.bpmn file). No configuration is needed to complete the conversion.

   This Java code defines a KNIME node model for a tool that converts a Petri net representation to a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) representation. The code implements the logic for the conversion process, handling various aspects of the Petri net, such as places, transitions, arcs, and markings. The conversion involves creating a BPMN diagram and mapping elements between the Petri net and BPMN representations. The code also addresses specific cases, such as handling transitions without incoming flows, removing dead places, and ensuring a proper conversion. It utilizes the Process Mining (PM4Knime) and KNIME APIs for handling Petri net and BPMN data structures. Additionally, the code includes methods for handling free-choice nets, simplifying BPMN diagrams, and managing initial and final markings. The node model is integrated into the KNIME workflow environment, and it outputs a BPMN representation as a result.
