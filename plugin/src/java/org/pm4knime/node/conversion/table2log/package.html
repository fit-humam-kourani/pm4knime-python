This package implements the node Table2XLog Converter. This node converts the Data Table 
to event log PortObject. 
<p>
The <code>Table2XLogConverterModel</code> accepts a DataTable as input and creates an event log PortObject. 
<p>
The <code>Table2XLogConverterDialog</code> requires the mapping between the DataTable columns to 
the trace and event attributes in event log.
