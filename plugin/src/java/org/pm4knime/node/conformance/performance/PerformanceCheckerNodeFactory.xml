	<shortDescription>
		Based on the alignments after replaying, this node calculates the performance on time. 
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		This node is based on the alignment result from PNReplayer, and calculates the performance information on Petri net. 
		Usually, Strategy type of the previous replayer is A*-ILP Based Manifest Replayer.
		
		At end, the performance information is given on tables, such as<br/> global cases, transitions, and places of Petri net. 
		Also, the performance projection on Petri net is shown in view.  
		<br />
			More information seen in the :
			<a href="http://goo.gl/EmiDJ">paper</a> and
			<a href="https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/Packages/PetriNetReplayAnalysis/">codes</a>.
		</intro>

		<option name="Time stamp">The attribute is chosen as the complete time to
			calculate the performance.
			In default, it is set as the complete time. More choices will be seen
			in the future version.
		</option>
		<option name="Consider performance in syn moves">It is true in default.</option>
		<option name="Include unreliable replay results">Choose to include unreliable replay result in
			performance calculation.
			It is true in default.
