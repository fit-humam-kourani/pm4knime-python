This package implements the node Performance Checker in KNIME. 
This node is based on the alignment result from PNReplayer, 
 and calculates the throughput time on Petri net. 
<p>
The <code>PerformanceCheckerModel</code> implements the ProM plugin in PNetReplayer 
with replayed Alignment as input. 
<p>
The <code>PerformanceCheckerDialog</code> requires time stamp attributes in the event log 
to calculate the performance information based on throughput time.
<p>
The <code>PerformanceCheckerView</code> shows the performance projection on Petri net.
