This package implements the alignment-replay algorithms. It includes two nodes,
one is with unified settings for all transitions, while the other node
allows separate configuration for each cost. 
<p>
The <code>DefaultPNReplayerModel</code> allows unified cost setting and suitable
for loop operation.
<p>
The <code>PNReplayerDialog</code> allows for specific cost settings 
for each transition.
