    <name>Precision Checker</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
       Based on the replayed alignment result of the event log and Petri net, the node Precision Checker measures the precision.

        <intro>
        Conceptually, the precision of a process model compared to one event log is supposed to be (1) high when the model 
        allows for few traces not seen in the log; and (2) low when it allows for many traces not seen in the log.   
        
        This node implements the Escaping Edges Precision (ETC) Conformance plugin from ProM. 
        It accepts the inputs of a Petri net and an event log, calculates the values for percision metrics and the
 Minimal Disconformant Traces [MDT] (traces that helps to identify the exact
 point where the model begins to allow more behaviour than the log).

				<li>1-Align Precision.</li>
				<li>All-Align Precision.</li>
				<li>Representative-Align Precision.</li>
				<li>ETC Precision (no invisible/duplicates allowed). Escaping Edges Precision (ETC) calculates precision 
				between an event log and a Petri net by constructing a prefix automaton and computing the escaping edges. 
				Escaping edges are activities that are allowed as next activities in the process model but that are never observed in the event log 
				after this prefix. In order to improve the precision measure robust to non-fitting traces, alignments are used to
				 calculate the prefix automation.
