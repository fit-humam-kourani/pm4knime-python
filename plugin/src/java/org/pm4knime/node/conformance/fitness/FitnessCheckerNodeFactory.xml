    <shortDescription>
        Based on the alignments after replaying, this node outputs the statistical fitness information.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node is based on the result from alignment-based replayer, and calculates the fitness information on Petri net. 
        The measurement is conducted based on one of the best matching instances between each trace in the log and the model. 
        Because the information is always included by the replayer, so there is no option to be chosen from this nodes.
