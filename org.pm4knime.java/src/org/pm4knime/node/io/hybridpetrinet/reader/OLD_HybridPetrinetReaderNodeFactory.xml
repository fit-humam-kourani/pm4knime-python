        <intro>Import a hybrid Petri net from a PNML file. A hybrid Petri net is a directed graph used to model processes. It consists of places, transitions, and directed arcs connecting them. A place is enabled if it it contains at least one token. A transition can only fire if all incoming places are enabled. After firing a transition, a token is consumed from all of its incoming places, and a token is produced in all of its outgoing places. The initial marking indicates the initial state of the hybrid Petri net. Places that belong to the initial marking are marked by green tokens inside them. The final marking denotes the final state of the hybrid Petri net. Places within the final marking are highlighted with a heavier border. A hybrid Petri net can also contain arcs directly connecting transitions to indicate informal dependencies between them. We distinguish three types of informal arcs: (1) strong dependencies are represented by blue solid arcs (certain arcs); (2) weak dependencies are represented by red dotted arcs (uncertain arcs); (3) long-term dependencies are represented by orange solid arcs.</intro>
