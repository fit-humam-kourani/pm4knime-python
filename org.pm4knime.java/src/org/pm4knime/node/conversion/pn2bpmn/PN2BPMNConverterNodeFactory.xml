   		<b>About PN2BPMN Converter:</b>
   		</resource> <br /> 
   			This KNIME node converts a Petri net representation to a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) representation. The code implements the logic for the conversion process, handling various aspects of the Petri net, such as places, transitions, arcs, and markings. The conversion involves creating a BPMN diagram and mapping elements between the Petri net and BPMN representations. This node also addresses specific cases, such as handling transitions without incoming flows, removing dead places, and ensuring a proper conversion. It utilizes the Process Mining (PM4Knime) and KNIME APIs for handling Petri net and BPMN data structures. Additionally, the code of this node includes methods for handling free-choice nets, simplifying BPMN diagrams, and managing initial and final markings. The node model is integrated into the KNIME workflow environment, and it outputs a BPMN representation as a result.

   		<b>Petri Net:</b><br /> A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph that visualizes all possible traces (order of executed activities). A Petri net consists of places, transitions, and directed arcs that connect them. Arcs can either connect places with transitions or transitions with places. Places can contain tokens. The placement of tokens defines the state of the Petri net. There is a start and a final state. The start state has only a token in the green place (initial place). The goal state has only a token in the double margin place (final place). A place is enabled if it it contains at least one token. A transition can only fire if all incoming places are enabled. After firing a transition, a token is consumed from all of its incoming places, and a token is produced in all of its outgoing places.

     	<b>BPMN:</b><br />
		    BPMN, or Business Process Model and Notation, encompasses several key elements that collectively define and illustrate a business process. Activities, depicted as rectangular shapes, symbolize the actual work within the process. Events signify occurrences during the process, with Start Events represented by green circles, End Events by red circles with bold borders, and Intermediate Events by circles with double borders.
		
		    Gateways, visualized as diamond shapes, play a crucial role in controlling the flow of execution within a process. They facilitate decision-making, split the flow into multiple paths, or merge paths into a single one. Various Gateway Types include EXCLUSIVE (✕), PARALLEL (✚), COMPLEX (❋), INCLUSIVE (◯), and EVENTBASED (⌾).
		
			Flows, crucial for sequencing activities, delineate the order and connections between activities. These elements collectively provide a comprehensive visualization of business processes in BPMN, ensuring clarity in understanding and managing workflows
